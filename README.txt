Assignment: 4 


Purpose: Assignment 4 is an application that moniters a network and its changes. There are 8
	 different options that can be applied to the application which gives ways to modify 
         the graph or view the status of the network. 

Classes: I have used Sedgewick's classes from his website http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ and I have put 
	 them into my project. The other classes that I have made are the following: 

	 Main.java : This will execute the entire application
	 MyFunctions.java : This is where all of my functions are stored for each option. 

	 Alternatively, I have slightly modified a few of Sedgewick's classes to work with my functions.

Execution: In order to execute this applications please do the following: 
		1. javac Main.java 
		2. java Main graph.txt 
	   After step 2 has been executed, you will be faced with commands for the application. 
	   Note: graph.txt is a text file with the example graph given on courseweb. 

Problems: There are no problems in this application.
